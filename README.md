# Travel Tales

Travel Tales is an Android application that allows users to log in, create journals, and add entries to each of their journals. This README provides an overview of the application's functionality, how to set it up, and details about key components and their implementation.

## Features
- User Authentication: Users can log in to the app using their email and password. Upon successful login, they receive a token for authenticated requests.
  
- Journal Management: Users can create, edit, and view journals. Each journal contains multiple entries. All the journals are listed for one user upon once they are logged in.
  
- Entry Management: Users can view entries within a journal.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- Node.js
- MySQL database

### Setting Up the Backend

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/chachamottaki/travel-journal.git
    cd travel-journal/backend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up your MySQL database and update the `.env` file with your database credentials:

    ```sh
    DB_USER=yourusername
    DB_PASS=yourpassword
    DB_NAME=travel-journal
    ```

4. Run the migrations to set up the database:

    ```sh
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
    ```

5. Start the backend server:

    ```sh
    node server.js
    ```

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. Open the Android project in Android Studio:

    ```sh
    cd traveltales
    ```

2. Sync the project with Gradle files and ensure all dependencies are installed.

3. Run the application on an emulator or a physical device.
